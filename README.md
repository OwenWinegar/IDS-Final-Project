# Intrusion Detection Mini Project (Snort + Linux)

## Overview
Demonstrates how common network attacks are detected using Snort and log monitoring tools on Linux. Includes custom Snort rules, network scans using Scapy, and log analysis.

## Features
- Custom Snort rules for TCP connect, SYN, XMAS scans, and ping sweeps
- Python scripts to simulate network scans and password guessing
- Log analysis from Snort alerts and iWatch monitoring
- Event correlation across multiple logs

## Technologies Used
- Snort IDS
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Python (Scapy)
- iWatch
- Bash & grep

## Project Structure
- `/scripts` — Python scripts from PDF
- `/snort-rules` — Custom rules
- `/logs` — Trimmed logs
- `/screenshots` — Screenshots of alerts and outputs

## What I Learned
- How IDS detects malicious traffic
- How scans appear in logs
- Correlating events across multiple logs
- Intrusion detection and system monitoring basics
